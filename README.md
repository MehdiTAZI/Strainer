Distributed parallel realtime filtering and buffering framework

In realtime bigdata environement filtering and buffering data in a consistence and distributed for processing rises many problems and causes I/O latency.

this framework aims to offer a simple optimized way to implement such mechanism by masking all the related problems and resolving differents realtime cases by filtering and buffering data in a distributed and parallelized way for realtime processing.
