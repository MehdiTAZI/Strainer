Distributed parallel realtime filtering and buffering framework

In a bigdata and/or realtime environements filtering and buffering data by type from a unique data source in order to process it rise different problems like the famous out of memory and I/O latency.

the framework aims to offer a simple optimized way to implement such mechanism and handling all the related problems. the framework aims to be resolve realtime cases by filtering and buffering data in a distributed way using parallelism and realtime processing.
